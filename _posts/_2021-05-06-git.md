**git push**: pushes your changes to your current working branch

**git push < branch name >**: eg git push origin/master, pushes your changes to a specific branch

# Pull
To get changes from the repo
**git fetch** : updates your local repository but does not update your local files
**git merge** : merges the files from your local repository to your local files

**git pull** : is a short command for git fetch and git merge. 

**git rebase** is an alternative to the merge which makes a merge per commit that results in a more clean result. If you get merge conflicts you need to fix them and then run **git rebase --continue** to finish the operation.
