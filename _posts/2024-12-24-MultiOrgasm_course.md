This is the content from the [online-course to multi-orgasm](https://www.theartoflove.nu/).
It was split up as an "advent calender" with a new peace of information every day

# Intro
Welcome to the Art of Love Advent Calendar—a 24-day course designed to help you become multi-orgasmic. This course is suitable for both men and women, whether single or in a relationship. It does, however, require dedication.

If you are truly serious about enhancing your pleasure, it's essential to commit fully to following each step of the course. Additionally, it’s recommended to practice celibacy until the course suggests otherwise. This will help you break free from habitual patterns around sex and create space for deeper, more meaningful experiences.

Good luck...

1. **Knowing what defines an orgasm is the first key to be multiorgasmic. An orgasm is a vibration or rhythmic spasm in a muscle or tissue.** It can be a tissue around the genitals, but not only. An orgasm can start in any muscle in the body and make the surrounding tissues vibrate in a delightful way. Ejaculation is NOT an orgasm. It is actually the result of a small local orgasm in the prostate. The same thing happens in a woman when she orgasms on the clit. Its a small and local experience of release. An orgasm makes your body deeply relaxed and it has a big impact on your hormone level. The bigger the orgasm, the more profound is the effect on the body. The orgasm actually improves the immune system and prolongs life, especially if the orgasm is long and full. It is possible to have orgasms that last between 5 - 60 minutes and both men and women can have multiple orgasms. Just knowing this is, can make your body open to new kinds of orgasms… Tomorrow you will get to know the important components of an orgasm.
1. **In order to have an orgasm, you need to be relaxed. Really relaxed.** The hormone oxytocin controls the rhythmic contractions in the body when you are having an orgasm. The more oxytocin you have in your blood, the more you will orgasm. Oxytocin is produced when caressing gently, cuddling, kissing and orgasming. So the more you cuddle while having sex or while masturbating, the more powerful orgasm you will get. There are certain body parts that are more prone to orgasm than others. Of course the genitals and our whole pelvic floor. There are big muscles, a lot of tissues and nerves there. But the abdomen, spine, breasts, lips, mouth and throat are super erogenous too. Inside of the arms, knees and our ears have a lot of nerves and try stimulating the teeth for deeper pleasure. The most important thing for having deep orgasms is to be present in the body. To really be here and now, and to allow your feelings to be free. An orgasm can only happen when you surrender to your bodily sensations.
1. **Porn is fun, sexy and many times it allows you to cum faster.** But porn is actually highly addictive and it creates sexual patterns that prevents you from being present in the body while being horny. Presence in the body is the FUNDAMENT for the multi orgasmic experience. Day one in this calendar is the day where you choose to refrain from porn for at least 21 days. Once you have learned to have multiple orgasms, you can choose to use porn again, if you want. Tomorrow you will get another super important key to a multiorgasmic life.
1. **Sexual fantasies are great and juicy.** BUT they also take your awareness out of your body when masturbating or having sex. The more presence you have in your body, the more pleasure you will feel. The more pleasure you will feel, the more orgasmic you will be. Try not to fantasize while having sex or mastrubating for the next days, and notice the magical difference in increasing pleasure
1. **Being goal oriented while masturbating or having sex prevents you from being present in the your body and your genitals.**
It actually raises the stress levels in your body and stress prevents you from having multiple orgasms. However you CAN have peak orgasms while being stressed. To achieve a peak orgasm you will tense your pelvic floor until you finally release the tension with a short and pleasurable twitch. Today is the day when you will let go completely of goal orientation during masturbation or sex. 
This means, refraining from ejaculation or vibrating stimulation of the clit. It's not forever! Only until you have taught your body to be multi orgasmic.
1. **Being able to be super present is essential for having a multiorgasmic body, the practice of mindfulness will definitely help you.** Today you will spend at least ten minutes exploring an object of your choice with your hands. Set the alarm on your phone, and explore the texture, shape and temperature of any object in your home. How much pleasure can you take from this object?
