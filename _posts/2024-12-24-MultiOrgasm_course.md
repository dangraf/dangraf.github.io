This is the content from the [online-course to multi-orgasm](https://www.theartoflove.nu/).
It was split up as an "advent calender" with a new peace of information every day

# Intro
Welcome to the Art of Love Advent Calendar—a 24-day course designed to help you become multi-orgasmic. This course is suitable for both men and women, whether single or in a relationship. It does, however, require dedication.

If you are truly serious about enhancing your pleasure, it's essential to commit fully to following each step of the course. Additionally, it’s recommended to practice celibacy until the course suggests otherwise. This will help you break free from habitual patterns around sex and create space for deeper, more meaningful experiences.

Good luck...

1. **Knowing what defines an orgasm is the first key to be multiorgasmic. An orgasm is a vibration or rhythmic spasm in a muscle or tissue.** It can be a tissue around the genitals, but not only. An orgasm can start in any muscle in the body and make the surrounding tissues vibrate in a delightful way. Ejaculation is NOT an orgasm. It is actually the result of a small local orgasm in the prostate. The same thing happens in a woman when she orgasms on the clit. Its a small and local experience of release. An orgasm makes your body deeply relaxed and it has a big impact on your hormone level. The bigger the orgasm, the more profound is the effect on the body. The orgasm actually improves the immune system and prolongs life, especially if the orgasm is long and full. It is possible to have orgasms that last between 5 - 60 minutes and both men and women can have multiple orgasms. Just knowing this is, can make your body open to new kinds of orgasms… Tomorrow you will get to know the important components of an orgasm.
1. **In order to have an orgasm, you need to be relaxed. Really relaxed.** The hormone oxytocin controls the rhythmic contractions in the body when you are having an orgasm. The more oxytocin you have in your blood, the more you will orgasm. Oxytocin is produced when caressing gently, cuddling, kissing and orgasming. So the more you cuddle while having sex or while masturbating, the more powerful orgasm you will get. There are certain body parts that are more prone to orgasm than others. Of course the genitals and our whole pelvic floor. There are big muscles, a lot of tissues and nerves there. But the abdomen, spine, breasts, lips, mouth and throat are super erogenous too. Inside of the arms, knees and our ears have a lot of nerves and try stimulating the teeth for deeper pleasure. The most important thing for having deep orgasms is to be present in the body. To really be here and now, and to allow your feelings to be free. An orgasm can only happen when you surrender to your bodily sensations.
1. **Porn is fun, sexy and many times it allows you to cum faster.** But porn is actually highly addictive and it creates sexual patterns that prevents you from being present in the body while being horny. Presence in the body is the FUNDAMENT for the multi orgasmic experience. Day one in this calendar is the day where you choose to refrain from porn for at least 21 days. Once you have learned to have multiple orgasms, you can choose to use porn again, if you want. Tomorrow you will get another super important key to a multiorgasmic life.
1. **Sexual fantasies are great and juicy.** BUT they also take your awareness out of your body when masturbating or having sex. The more presence you have in your body, the more pleasure you will feel. The more pleasure you will feel, the more orgasmic you will be. Try not to fantasize while having sex or mastrubating for the next days, and notice the magical difference in increasing pleasure
1. **Being goal oriented while masturbating or having sex prevents you from being present in the your body and your genitals.**
It actually raises the stress levels in your body and stress prevents you from having multiple orgasms. However you CAN have peak orgasms while being stressed. To achieve a peak orgasm you will tense your pelvic floor until you finally release the tension with a short and pleasurable twitch. Today is the day when you will let go completely of goal orientation during masturbation or sex. 
This means, refraining from ejaculation or vibrating stimulation of the clit. It's not forever! Only until you have taught your body to be multi orgasmic.
1. **Being able to be super present is essential for having a multiorgasmic body, the practice of mindfulness will definitely help you.** Today you will spend at least ten minutes exploring an object of your choice with your hands. Set the alarm on your phone, and explore the texture, shape and temperature of any object in your home. How much pleasure can you take from this object?

7. **Cultivating your ability to feel pleasure is an important key to being multiorgasmic.**
When you experience pleasure, the levels of oxytocin in your body increases. Oxytocin is one of the reasons why your body has an orgasm. The more pleasure you feel, the more oxytocin you get. And the more oxytocin you get, the more pleasure you feel. Today you will spend 10 minutes taking pleasure from one of your furniture. I could be your sofa, your bed or an armchair. How would your body move to be able to take as much pleasure as you can from this object?

Notice your feelings and thoughts when you do this exercise. Do you feel silly, inadequate or shameful? Then you probably have some deep blockages around pleasure and need to work on your attitudes around pleasure in life, maybe through tantra therapy! If you have this blockage I now offer you an 90 € discount on a tantric initiation during 2025. This is a powerful way to release the blockages that keeps you from feeling pleasure in life. Use the code ADVENT when you book to get the discount. 

8. **One of the most important tools in order to be multi orgasmic is self touch. If you can’t touch yourself to orgasm, how can you expect someone else to be able to do it for you?**
The more pleasure you can GIVE to yourself, the more safe and relaxed you will be together with someone else. And did you know that the ability to surrender to self pleasure actually makes you a magnet for other people? When you are safe enough to give yourself pleasure others will feel confident and relaxed together with you.
Today you will spend at least 15 min exploring your face with slow and soft self touch. Choose some really good music, turn on the alarm to make sure that you really give yor self the 15 minutes and then, give your beautiful face all the love and pleasure you deserve.
If you want, take a look at yourself in the mirror after… you will look stunning!

9. Today we will continue with sensual self touch, but today we will extend the time to 20 min and you will be touching your whole body. Sensual self touch is a powerful practice of self-care, self-exploration, and emotional nourishment. By dedicating 20 minutes as a ritual of self love, you will cultivate a profound connection with your body, awaken your senses, and nurture your inner self. This practice involves gentle, intentional touches, caressing your skin, exploring textures, and tuning into the sensations. It's not only about sexual pleasure but embracing your physicality with curiosity and compassion. It allows you to break free from stress, relax deeply, and discover areas of tension or emotional blockages. Engaging in sensual self touch for 20 minutes offers numerous benefits. It fosters body positivity, enhances self awareness, and promotes relaxation by releasing feel-good hormones like oxytocin. It's a meditative act that slows you down, brings you into the present moment, and builds a sense of self-love and acceptance. Incorporate elements like soothing oils, soft fabrics, or calming music to deepen the experience. This intimate practice is a gift to yourself—a celebration of your body, your worth, and your unique sensuality. Enjoy…

10. **Breath is a potent tool that connects the mind, body, and spirit, and when used consciously, it can unlock extraordinary states of pleasure, including a fullbody orgasm.** This type of orgasm goes beyond localized sensations, activating energy pathways throughout the body for a deeply expansive and transformative experience. By practicing intentional breathing—long, deep inhales followed by slow, intentional exhales—you can circulate energy through the body. This rhythmic breathing increases oxygen flow, heightens sensitivity, and deepens your connection to physical sensations. Combining breathwork with relaxation, movement, and visualization can activate the body’s energy centers, aligning them for a harmonious release of pleasure. The key lies in staying present and open, letting the breath guide you into surrender. Rather than focusing solely on a goal, allow the energy to build and flow freely. Over time, this practice can awaken your body’s full potential, dissolve tension, and invite waves of bliss that ripple through every part of you. It's a profound reminder of how deeply breath and pleasure are intertwined, offering a doorway to ecstasy through the simplest act of breathing.
11. Free dance, with its uninhibited movement and intuitive flow, is a powerful practice for awakening the body and accessing a full-body orgasmic state.
Turn on your favorite playlist and dance as if there is no tomorrow. Focus on intentional breathing and pelvic movements to further stimulate the energy centers (or chakras), particularly the sacral and root areas, which are directly connected to sensuality and pleasure. As energy rises, it radiates through the body, building into waves of orgasmic bliss that are not confined to one area but felt as a whole-body experience. By letting go of structure and expectations, free dance allows energy to move freely through your body, creating space for pleasure, vitality, and deep connection to your sensual self. When you engage in free dance, you release tension and stagnant energy stored in your muscles and joints. This release clears pathways for sexual energy to flow unimpeded. The rhythmic movement synchronizes with your breath, amplifying sensations and helping you stay grounded in your body. As you dance, you're not performing; you're exploring, feeling, and allowing your body to lead you toward pleasure. Free dance also fosters a sense of playfulness, self-expression, and surrender—key components in achieving a state of ecstasy. By moving freely to music or silence, you embrace your natural rhythms, letting your body guide you to a deeper, more expansive sense of pleasure and connection.

12. The spine is a central channel of energy in the body, and gentle, intentional spinal movements can significantly enhance your ability to experience a full-body orgasm and multiple orgasms.By awakening and aligning the spine, you open energy pathways that connect your entire body, allowing pleasure and sensation to flow freely. The spine houses the nervous system and is closely linked to the body's energy centers (chakras). Movements like undulations, waves, or circular motions along the spine help release tension, increase flexibility, and activate these centers, especially the sacral chakra, which governs sensuality and creativity. This activation encourages energy to rise from the base of the spine and spread throughout the body. Practices such as spinal waves, cat-cow stretches, or intuitive circular movements create a sense of fluidity and relaxation. Combined with deep, rhythmic breathing, these movements can stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting a state of deep relaxation and heightened receptivity to pleasure. Spinal movements also stimulate the release of endorphins and oxytocin, enhancing your body's natural capacity for bliss. As you move your spine with awareness, you invite a state of surrender and openness, key to experiencing a full-body orgasm. These motions help distribute the orgasmic energy, ensuring it isn't localized but flows like waves through your entire being, offering a profound and transcendent experience.
13. Sonds are very important parts of an orgasm. If you feel hesitant to make noises, it's probably due to embarrassment, awkward feelings, and shyness about your body's natural functions. An orgasm requires that you dare to let go of control and, in doing so, release all feelings of awkwardness. Sound has a profound impact on the body’s ability to experience pleasure because it directly engages the brain and nervous system. Certain sounds and frequencies stimulate the release of feel-good hormones like dopamine and serotonin, which enhance mood and relaxation. Rhythms and melodies can synchronize with the body's natural rhythms, such as the heartbeat, promoting a state of harmony and comfort. Additionally, sound activates the vagus nerve, which reduces stress and boosts sensations of well-being. This sensory stimulation creates a holistic experience, connecting the mind and body in a way that amplifies pleasure and emotional connection. Today you shall spend 5 minutes making loud pleasure noises to yourself. You can touch yourself in a pleasurable way, and add to the touch, sounds of enjoyment.
14. [**Video**](https://youtu.be/m8rqLiV8qE8)
Now, in this video you get a short tutorial on how to incorporate breath, sound and spine movement to experience a full body orgasm. The secret is to create a tension in the body and then relax and let it go
15. Today you are going to give your whole body pleasure, then you are allowed to masturbate and touch your genitals very VERY gently. But you are NOT supposed to cum or have a peak orgasm.
Touching the genitals gently is essential for enhancing sensitivity and maximizing pleasure because it allows the delicate nerve endings in this area to fully respond. The genital region contains a high concentration of nerve receptors, making it incredibly sensitive to even the slightest stimulation. Gentle touch minimizes overstimulation, which can sometimes desensitize the area or cause discomfort, ensuring that every sensation is nuanced and pleasurable. Slow, light contact also helps the body relax, increasing blood flow to the area and enhancing arousal. This mindful approach allows for greater anticipation and builds a deeper connection between physical sensations and emotional pleasure, creating a more fulfilling experience. By treating the body with care and attentiveness, you allow sensitivity to flourish, leading to heightened pleasure and intimacy.
16. Today you are going to try kegel exercises.
Kegels are equally important for men as well as woman. A person who has an active pelvic floor can give the most amazing pleasure to his/her lovers. With relaxed and healthy muscles around the vagina and penis, you will experience much deeper orgasms. Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which play a crucial role in sexual pleasure and overall intimate health. A strong pelvic floor enhances blood flow to the genital area, increasing sensitivity and arousal. For women, toned muscles can lead to more intense orgasms and greater control during intimacy, while for men, Kegels can improve erection strength, stamina, and control over ejaculation. Additionally, these exercises help prevent issues like incontinence and support core stability, contributing to overall physical well-being.
  1. Basic Kegel Contractions  
   - Identify your pelvic floor muscles by stopping the flow of urine. Then locate the muscles in the perineum, the anus and the muscles around your cervix or the ones that makes your penis “jump”. Once identified, contract the different pelvic muscles separately for 5 seconds each, then relax for 5 seconds.  
   - Repeat 10–15 times, 2–3 times a day.
  2. Elevator Exercise  
   - Imagine your pelvic floor muscles are an elevator. Slowly contract them halfway ("first floor"), hold for 2–3 seconds, then fully contract ("second floor").  
   - Gradually release back down one "floor" at a time.  
   - Repeat 5–10 times for greater control and awareness.
  3. Quick Flicks  
   - Rapidly contract and release the pelvic floor muscles as quickly as possible.  
   - Aim for 10–20 quick contractions in a set, resting for a few seconds between sets.  
   - This exercise builds endurance and responsiveness in the pelvic muscles.
  Incorporating these exercises into your daily routine can significantly enhance your intimate experiences and overall pelvic health.
17. Did you know that a tantric man has a lingam instead of a penis? Lingam means “pillar of light,” and when a man has developed significant presence in his genitals, his lingam vibrates with energy and healing. The energy in a lingam is crystal clear. It embodies pure presence, feeling everything within you—your vulnerabilities, your wounds, your longings, and your needs. A tantric man understands that his partner's pleasure is also his pleasure. By attuning to his lover's pace, he can open his partner to deeper levels of surrender and connection. As a man, you are about to develop this presence in your lingam by letting go of goal-oriented sex and opening your whole body to orgasmic pleasure. Today, I invite you to do a 15-minute meditation where you imagine having a pillar of crystal-clear light between your legs. You can gently stroke your lingam to awaken its sensitivity and deepen this awareness. If you are a woman and want to explore the crystal-clear energy of a lingam, you can use a wand. I highly recommend the crystal wand from Tachyon. It doesn’t have fancy features, but the yoni loves its simplicity, and it creates the most exquisite orgasms around it.
18. Now we have been focusing on the body a LOT in this course.
It is important to be able to feel the body in order to fully experience sexual pleasure. How ever, we must not forget the mental horniness and that's why we take that chapter now...
Mental arousal, or "mental horniness," is a crucial element in unlocking the body's orgasmic potential because it bridges the mind and body, amplifying sexual pleasure and responsiveness. The brain is the largest and most powerful sexual organ; it processes desires, fantasies, and emotions that fuel arousal. Without mental engagement, physical sensations alone can feel disconnected or incomplete. When the mind is turned on, it enhances the body's sensitivity and responsiveness to touch, heightening the intensity of pleasure. Mental arousal also triggers the release of dopamine and oxytocin, the feel-good hormones that are essential for experiencing deep pleasure and emotional connection. It allows you to fully immerse yourself in the moment, reducing distractions and opening pathways for deeper orgasms. Additionally, mental horniness can unlock new layers of pleasure through anticipation, imagination, and intimacy. The more your mind is involved, the more expansive and fulfilling your orgasmic experiences can become. By cultivating erotic thoughts and emotional connection, you align your body and mind, creating the perfect environment for profound, full-body pleasure. During sex and masturbation, it's better to actually feel the body, but in order for your juices to flow fully, we can use sexual fantasies to prepare the body for masturbation or sex. Today, write a short text about a very horny fantasy that you have, and notice the feelings in your body when you do. If you have a partner, share this text with your partner. Another way to include the mind during sex without escaping from the body is to learn how to "fuck talk". To talk sexy to your partner about what you would like to do to them or what you want them to do to you while having sex...
19. Today we are going to experience edging.
Edging, the practice of bringing yourself close to orgasm and then backing off before climax, is a powerful way to increase orgasmic potential. This technique helps build arousal gradually, intensifying the eventual release and making orgasms longer and more satisfying. By prolonging the arousal phase, edging increases blood flow to the genitals, heightens sensitivity, and strengthens pelvic floor muscles.
It also teaches greater self-control, enhancing your ability to manage and extend pleasure. Over time, edging rewires the body's response to stimulation, allowing you to experience deeper and more intense sensations, leading to stronger, more fulfilling orgasms.
This is how it is done:
Engage is any sexual activity, like masturbation or sex. When you start to feel that you are about 75% and the climax is coming closer, stop for a while. Continue to touch other parts of the body and allow the energy to slow down. Then as you get more aroused, allow it to grow until about 85%, then relax and touch the rest of the body. Continue to come closer and closer to the climax and learn how to stop just before it.
This method is also very good for men who suffers from premature ejaculation.
20. Today we are going to awaken your senses through your tastebuds. Sensory awakening shifts your focus from the mind to the body, heightening your ability to experience subtle pleasures and amplifying the sensations that lead to profound orgasmic states. When all your senses are alive and attuned, your body becomes more receptive, making every touch, sound, and taste more vivid and arousing. Food is a powerful tool for awakening the senses because it engages taste, smell, sight, and even touch. Here’s how to use food to heighten your sensual awareness:
    1. Mindful Eating: Choose a small piece of something luxurious, like chocolate, a ripe strawberry, or a piece of mango. Close your eyes and focus on the texture, aroma, and taste as you let it slowly melt in your mouth. This practice trains you to savor every sensation, creating a deeper connection to pleasure.
    2. Engage Smell and Taste: Experiment with foods that have rich and complex aromas, like spices, herbs, or wine. Smell the food deeply before tasting, allowing your sense of smell to heighten the anticipation and pleasure of the experience.
    3. Touch and Texture: Use your hands to explore the texture of the food before eating it. Feel its smoothness, roughness, or juiciness—this tactile engagement helps you become more attuned to the sensations of touch in all areas of your body.
    4. Visual Feast: Arrange food beautifully, incorporating vibrant colors and shapes. Visual stimulation can increase arousal and help you appreciate the beauty in what you consume.
By using food to heighten your sensory awareness, you train your body to recognize and savor subtle sensations, laying the foundation for deeper and more fulfilling orgasmic pleasure.

21. Today we will explore a very advanced and powerful technique to deepen the orgasmic pleasure. Breath retention, or controlled pauses in your breathing, can be a powerful tool for enhancing the depth and intensity of orgasms. It works by increasing your awareness of bodily sensations, circulating sexual energy, and activating the parasympathetic nervous system to deepen relaxation and pleasure. Here's how to use breath retention to enhance your orgasmic experience:

    1. Prepare Your Body with Deep Breathing
      - Start by practicing deep, diaphragmatic breathing to calm your mind and oxygenate your body.
      - Breathe in deeply through your nose for 4-6 seconds, expanding your belly, and exhale gently for the same count. Repeat this for 1-2 minutes.
    2. Engage in Breath Retention During Arousal
      - As you approach higher levels of arousal, inhale deeply and hold your breath for 3-5 seconds before slowly exhaling.
      - While holding your breath, focus on the sensations in your body, particularly in your pelvic area. Imagine the sexual energy building and circulating.
    3. Combine Retention with Muscle Engagement
      - During breath retention, gently contract your pelvic floor muscles (similar to a Kegel exercise). This helps to intensify and direct the energy upward through your body.
      - Release the contraction as you exhale, allowing the energy to flow naturally.
    4. Use Retention to Edge
      - If you're edging (approaching orgasm without climaxing), use breath retention when you're close to the peak. This helps you hold the energy and redistribute it throughout your body, prolonging the arousal phase and deepening your orgasmic potential.
    5. Focus on Full-Body Energy
      - During retention, visualize your breath and energy traveling up your spine and spreading through your body. This technique, often used in tantric and Taoist practices, can turn localized pleasure into a full-body orgasm.
    6. During Orgasm
      - Just before climax, inhale deeply and hold your breath for a few seconds, focusing all your awareness on the sensation. Release your breath slowly as you orgasm to amplify the intensity and duration of the experience. Practicing breath retention regularly can transform your sexual experience, unlocking new layers of depth, intensity, and connection.

22. Today we are going to try an advanced tantric practice, called the Micro Cosmic Orbit.
    1. Preparation: Grounding and Relaxation
    - Sit comfortably in a quiet place, either on a chair with your feet flat on the ground or cross-legged on a cushion.
    - Close your eyes and take several deep breaths, focusing on relaxing your body. Imagine your body as an open, receptive vessel for energy.
    - Rest your tongue lightly against the roof of your mouth (just behind your front teeth). This completes the energy circuit between the Du and Ren channels.
    2. Activate the pelvic floor
    - Focus your attention on the swathistana chakra, a point located about two inches below your navel and inside your body. This is the body's main energy center.
    - Breathe deeply into your Lower Dantian, imagining it filling with warm, glowing light or energy. Feel this energy as a gentle, vibrant sensation.
    3. Begin the Energy Flow
    - With your awareness, guide the energy from your Lower Dantian down to your perineum (the area between your genitals and anus).
    - From the perineum, direct the energy up your spine, vertebra by vertebra, all the way to the top of your head.
    - Pause at the crown of your head and feel the energy gathering there.
    4. Complete the Orbit
    - Allow the energy to flow down the front of your body along the spine, passing through your forehead, nose, chest, and back to your Lower Dantian.
    - Imagine the energy completing a circular flow through your body, connecting the back and front pathways.
    5. Synchronize with Your Breath
    - Inhale as you guide the energy up your spine.
    - Exhale as you guide the energy down the front of your body.
    - Repeat this cycle several times, visualizing the orbit as a continuous, smooth flow of light or energy.
    6. Enhancing the Practice
    - If desired, use your hands to help guide the energy. For example, trace your hands up your back and down the front of your body to reinforce the flow.
    - Focus on sensations of warmth, tingling, or vibrancy as signs that the energy is circulating effectively.
    7. Closing the Practice
    - After several minutes or longer, return your awareness to your Lower Dantian and let the energy settle there.
    - Imagine the energy condensing into a small, glowing sphere in your Lower Dantian. This ensures that your energy is grounded and stored.
    Benefits of the Microcosmic Orbit:
    - Enhances energy circulation and clears blockages.
    - Cultivates sexual energy for healing and pleasure.
    - Promotes emotional balance and mental clarity.
    - Strengthens the connection between the mind and body. With regular practice, the Microcosmic Orbit can help you access deeper levels of vitality, connection, and pleasure, both in daily life and during intimacy.
   
  23. Let's explore deeper orgasms then only the ones coming from touching your face, your body and your genitals.
The body’s ability to experience orgasms in areas beyond the genitals, such as the throat and anus, highlights the incredible capacity of the nervous system and mind to process pleasure in unexpected ways. These types of orgasms occur when these areas are stimulated with awareness, relaxation, and an openness to exploring the body’s full sensual potential.
Throat Orgasms
The throat contains a high concentration of nerve endings and is closely connected to the vagus nerve, which plays a significant role in the body's relaxation and pleasure responses. The throat is also energetically linked to self-expression and emotional release, making it a powerful area for experiencing deep pleasure. Vocalization, deep breathing, and gentle stimulation (like sensual touch or even singing) can awaken this area. Relaxing the throat and allowing energy to flow freely between the chest and head can lead to sensations of release and even orgasmic waves.
Anal Orgasms
The anus is another area rich in nerve endings, making it highly sensitive to touch and capable of producing profound pleasure when approached gently and with care. For all genders, the anus connects to deeper structures like the pelvic floor, prostate (for men), and G-spot area (for women), which amplifies orgasmic potential. Relaxation is crucial to allow pleasure to build without tension. When the body is fully at ease, anal stimulation can lead to intense orgasms that radiate throughout the entire body, creating a deep sense of surrender and connection.
Unlocking These Orgasms
    1. Relaxation: Release physical and mental tension through deep breathing and creating a safe, calm environment.
    2. Gentle Exploration: Approach these areas with sensitivity, using touch, massage, or specific techniques like breathwork or sound to stimulate energy flow.
    3. Energy Circulation: Visualize energy moving from the throat or anus through the body, connecting with other erogenous zones to enhance full-body pleasure.
Exploring these areas not only broadens your orgasmic experiences but also deepens your relationship with your body, helping you access new dimensions of intimacy and connection.
24. Now, if you followed the instructions in this online course... you should probably be multiorgasmic already.
But if you still aren't, don't be disappointed. Its probably because there is still an amount of goal orientation or tension in you.
Relaxing and surrendering to erotic energy is essential for experiencing a full-body orgasm because it allows you to let go of control and fully immerse yourself in the sensations of pleasure. Tension and resistance in the body block the natural flow of sexual energy, confining it to specific areas. When you relax, you open pathways for this energy to move freely throughout your body, transforming localized pleasure into a profound, whole-body experience.
Surrendering requires trusting your body and the moment, letting go of any performance pressure or mental distractions. This openness allows you to connect deeply with your sensations, emotions, and energy, unlocking the potential for a full-body orgasm that transcends physical release and becomes a deeply fulfilling, holistic experience.
