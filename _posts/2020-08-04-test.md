# Project execution
I write this part because it's always debatable about how to run a project and cooperate with other departments within the company. This is supposed to be seen as a template that can be used together with a team to agree on the way you are working together to minimize misunderstandings and unnessecery work.

# Overview
Most project can be divided into diefferent parts.
- **Selection phase:** where it's decided that the project will be resourced and executed
- **Planning phase:** The team sets up goals, milestones and metrics
- **execution phase:** The team runs the project
- **Evaluation:** Initial release of the project
- **Support:** The product usually needs to be updated to fix minor errors etc.

This post will mainly focus on the **execution phase**
