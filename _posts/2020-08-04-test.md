# Project execution
I write this part because it's always debatable about how to run a project and cooperate with other departments within the company. This is supposed to be seen as a template that can be used together with a team to agree on the way you are working together to minimize misunderstandings and unnessecery work.
My notes are based on information I got during my own experience, Scrum workshops, books like "Lean Management" (ISBN:978-91-47-09449-3) and "Praktisk projektledning" (ISBN:978-91-631-9605-8).

# Define the problem
We need to agree on how to work together that encurage members to take initiative, explore possiblilities and still thive towards the same goal. To acheve this goal, we just follow the rule of plan-do-check-act for both iterating over the project to constantly update the goals. But we also need to update our way of working. 
To do this we need written processes that describes our current way of working. We continously challange the processes to find ways to make the work easier with better outcome.


# Overview
We want to create an organisation based on responsibility where everyone feel the urge to fix things to the better. Most organisations have a top-down management with responsibilities which often leads to debates about who is responsible and pie thowing. 
We need to agree on how to work together that encurage members to take initiative, explore possiblilities and still thive towards the same goal. To acheve this, we just follow the rule of [plan-do-check-act/adjust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) for both iterating over the project to constantly update the goals. But we also need to update our way of working.

## Two loops
You can say there are two loops running this iteration while running your project. One is to reach the project goal and the other is how to improve the way of working.

### Example Project goal iteration:
- **plan**: find out our current situation and identify desired state and try to find a way to reach it.
- **do**: we work in a "sprint" to close the gap between our two states.
- **check**: after eg 3weeks, we stop and check where we are right now.
- **act/adjust**: did it go according to plan? did anything become better? keep the good things and throw away the bad things. then do another iteration.

### Example way of working iteration:
- **plan**: identify how we are working today and how we would like to work. (identify flaws/improvements in our process, and select solutions)
- **do**: try out the solutions
- **check**: measure if there was an actual improvement in our work
- **act/adjust**: update the process if the change was good.

### Processes:
Every company has processes to follow, some with success. How do we think here? A process shall ideally contain how to work, which goals we would like to acheve (explaines the "5 x why") and how to check if we are doing correct.
One way to remember is that our processes shall be seen as a "baseline" that makes it possible to compare our changes against. This makes it possible to constantly improve. It shall not be seen as a statue that only shall be seen and never touched. That's why it's important to be able to measure the outcome to know if we made an improvement. The goals is important to know if the change we did affects all previous goals and not only the one that is important for the moment. One common mistake is to not explain the "why" which makes it open for speculations and no-one dares to change the document.

### Exploration, exploatation:
This is an important part of both itteration loops. We both need to be efficient and harvest the fruits of our hard earned learnings (exploration) but also need to continue to grow our knowlage (exploatation). Sometimes we get stuck in either of these states and could use this expression to communicate to the group to focus more on the one or another. For example, if we would like the team to work more efficiently, one way is to tell them they need to work faster with maintained quality (does not often give good resluts). Or we could tell them/ give them the opertunity to explore new ways of working and update the processes.


# Roles
Anyway, we still need responsibilities.
To make it easier to work together, the following roles are defined as follows:

* **Project Owner**: The person who pays for the project. Need to get deeply involved into the project to be able to ask intelligent leading questions about how the project is progressing. Never tells  directly what to do since then you remove the responsibility. Leads and coaches the team and wants to know what the plan looks like. Assumes there will be problems and that nothig goes as planned.
* **Scrum Master**: A person from the team who are responsible for modderating meetings.
* **Team members**: 1-8ih people who perfrom the actual work. They are responsible for planning the project together, breaking down the goals into smaller tasks, time-estimations of all tasks and tries to keep their estimations.

# Phases
These are execution phases in the project:
![](/images/project_workflow.svg)
1. **Project start:** One of the most common mistakes is to throw yourself over a solution before actually understanding the problem (looking at data, talking to people, finding the root cause summorized into one sentence).
.The following ![define_the_problem template](Project_plan_template.md) can be used to understand the problem a bit better.  Also determine how the feedback loop will look-like. Some useful links: [7-step problem solving](https://usa.24alife.com/advice/stress/7-steps-in-resolving-problems), [A3 Gemba](https://www.shmula.com/the-toyota-a3-report/363/)
1. **Planning (team):** The team breaks down the prioritized list of objectives and distrubutes the tasks. A prioritized list is prepeared for the Demo which will be re-prioritized by the project owner. There are alternatives to move this part to after the demo to do a more detailed planning after feedback from the demo.

1. **Demo (team + owner):** The team tries to show tasks and goals that are ready to be shown for the project owner. They also updates the project-plan together with the project owner since more knowlage has been gathered to solve the problem. Finaly they go thru the prioritzed list and let the product owner re-organize about what need to be done. 
I'ts always a good idea to have a small chat with the team after the meeting to discuss things that could be improved for the next meeting and summorize key insights and information.
1. **Sprint Retrospect (team):** The team improves itself by eg creating a time-line about good/bad things, discussing how to improve them selves, eg get better tools, fix missing documents etc. Select the top most importand tasks and set an owner and time estimate for each task to fix and try to squeeze it in the upcomming sprint. 
There are [different ways](https://backlog.com/blog/three-ways-run-productive-retrospective/) to do a retrospective. One way that is not listed is to create a timeline together with the team to refresh the memory and put postits on what's good and bad. Use the postits to create a row for improvements and another for things to continue with. If too many things aprear in the "fixed" column, it might be a good idea to try to find if they relate to eachother to find the root cause. Then assign a person or team to fix the problem.

1. **execution (team):** The team executes the tasks in the prioritized list.

### Questions:
- How often skall we have the meetings? Decide a date for meetings.
- Members, shall they have single competence seen separate goals for each one man team. Or shall we share our work?
- Does the project owner atted to the retrospects or shall feedback be given during the meetings?


## Templates
### Startup:
Fill in the project plan ![define_the_problem template](Project_plan_template.md)
One of the most common mistakes is to throw yourself over a solution before actually understanding the problem (looking at data, talking to people etc). Here are some useful links for understanding when you have understood the problem.

# Sprint Meeting
Things we want to discuss.
- Demo: Show finished tasks (show current state):
  - Show how the feature/thing is working
  - Share learnings.
  - Share important decisions that was made during this phase and the background for that decision.
  - Raise risks that was found to be able to prioritize upcomming sprint.
  - show where we are and workload for reaching current goal (burndown chart?)
 - Update the project plan (dicuss desired state):
 - Present a prioritized list of tasks/questions/problems to be solved for the upcomming sprint(broken down to eg 1-2weeks of work). 
 - Let the Project owner re-arrange the list and give feedback to the group.

### Questions:
- Which topics can be removed, or shall something be added?
- How accurat shall the timing estimates be?
- Shall the team commit for the prioritized (must be finished untill next sprint) or shall the team just try to finnish as many as possible?


** Startup phase
Most project can be divided into diefferent parts.
- **Selection phase:** where it's decided that the project will be resourced and executed
- **Startup phase:** The team sets up goals, milestones and metrics
- **execution phase:** The team runs the project
- **Evaluation:** Initial release of the project
- **Support:** The product usually needs to be updated to fix minor errors etc.
