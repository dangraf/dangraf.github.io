# Project execution
I write this part because it's always debatable about how to run a project and cooperate with other departments within the company. This is supposed to be seen as a template that can be used together with a team to agree on the way you are working together to minimize misunderstandings and unnessecery work.
My notes are based on information I got during my own experience, Scrum workshops, books like "Lean Management" (ISBN:978-91-47-09449-3) and "Praktisk projektledning" (ISBN:978-91-631-9605-8).

# Overview
Most project can be divided into diefferent parts.
- **Selection phase:** where it's decided that the project will be resourced and executed
- **Startup phase:** The team sets up goals, milestones and metrics
- **execution phase:** The team runs the project
- **Evaluation:** Initial release of the project
- **Support:** The product usually needs to be updated to fix minor errors etc.

Regardles on where you are in the project, the following rule matters for improving the plan, the execution and how to work with your team mates.

To be more clear, this is the different states in the project model:
![](/images/project_workflow.svg)
1. **Planning (team):** The Sprint has just finnished and the members prepare the demo, updates the project plan and proposes a list of tasks for the next sprint.
1. **Demo (team + owner):** The team tries to show tasks and goals that are ready to be shown for the project owner. They also updates the project-plan together with the project owner since more knowlage has been gathered to solve the problem. Finaly they go thru the prioritzed list and let the product owner re-organize about what need to be done. 
1. **Retrospect (team):** The team improves itself by eg creating a time-line about good/bad things, discussing how to improve them selves, eg get better tools, fix missing documents etc. Select the top most importand tasks and set an owner and time estimate for each task to fix and try to squeeze it in the upcomming sprint. 
1. **execution (team):** The team executes the tasks in the prioritized list.

# Overview
We want to create an organisation based on responsibility where everyone feel the urge to fix things to the better. Most organisations have a top-down management with responsibilities which often leads to debates about who is responsible and pie thowing. Anyway, we still need responsibilities.
To make it easier to work together, the following roles are defined as follows:
* **Project Owner**: The person who pays for the project. Need to get deeply involved into the project to be able to ask intelligent leading questions about how the project is progressing. Never tells  directly what to do since then you remove the responsibility. Leads and coaches the team and wants to know what the plan looks like. Assumes there will be problems and that nothig goes as planned.
* **Scrum Master**: A person from the team who are responsible for modderating meetings.
* **Team members**: 1-8ih people who perfrom the actual work. They are responsible for planning the project together, breaking down the goals into smaller tasks, time-estimations of all tasks and tries to keep their estimations.

** Startup phase
