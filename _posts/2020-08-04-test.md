# Project execution
I write this part because it's always debatable about how to run a project and cooperate with other departments within the company. This is supposed to be seen as a template that can be used together with a team to agree on the way you are working together to minimize misunderstandings and unnessecery work.
My notes are based on information I got during my own experience, Scrum workshops, books like "Lean Management" (ISBN:978-91-47-09449-3) and "Praktisk projektledning" (ISBN:978-91-631-9605-8).

# Overview
Most project can be divided into diefferent parts.
- **Selection phase:** where it's decided that the project will be resourced and executed
- **Startup phase:** The team sets up goals, milestones and metrics
- **execution phase:** The team runs the project
- **Evaluation:** Initial release of the project
- **Support:** The product usually needs to be updated to fix minor errors etc.

Regardles on where you are in the project, the following rule matters for improving the plan, the execution and how to work with your team mates.

# Management
We want to create an organisation based on responsibility where everyone feel the urge to fix things to the better. Most organisations have a top-down management with responsibilities which often leads to debates about who is responsible. Anyway, we still need responsibilities.
To make it easier to work together, the following roles are defined as follows:
* **Project Owner**: The person who pays for the project. Need to get deeply involved into the project to be able to ask intelligent leading questions about how the project is progressing. Never tells  directly what to do since then you remove the responsibility. Leads and coaches the team and wants to know what the plan looks like. Assumes there will be problems and that nothig goes as planned.
* **Scrum Master**: A person from the team who are responsible for modderating meetings.
* **Team members**: 1-8ih people who perfrom the actual work.

** Startup phase
